`Using vectorized operations and more efficient data structures can improve the efficiency and speed in which our code get executed.`

### What are Vectorized operations?

The term vectorization is mostly used in the context of numpy and pandas. vectorization in python simple means implementing array operations without using For loops.
Instead, functions defined by various modules which are highly optimized are used, this functions reduces the running and execution time of code.
